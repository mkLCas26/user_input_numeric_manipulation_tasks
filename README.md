<p> This repository also serves as a documentation for my 4 batches of accomplished programs in my course, Object Oriented Programming.</p>

<p> Contents of this repository circulate on programs that will ask a user for a number input and execute an output based on certain conditions (e.g. printing the highest/lowest number, printing number with duplicates, or sum). </p>
